The project has taken him throughout Vietnam, including Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), Nha Trang, Mue Nie, Phan Thiet, the Mekong, Sapa, Ninh Binh and the Perfume Pagoda. His images capture scenes and people from women in conical hats planting rice along the Red River in the north to men and women working in the floating markets on the Mekong River and its tributaries. Robert's project also captures the traditions of ancient Asia in the rural markets, Buddhist Monasteries and the celebrations around Tet, the Lunar New Year. Also to be found are images of the emerging modern Vietnam, such as young people eating and drinking and embracing the fashions and music of the West. His book.
